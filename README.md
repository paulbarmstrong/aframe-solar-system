## Details

* Author: Paul Armstrong

## Plans

* Implement methods of navigation in VR
* Allow for the camera to follow planets' frame of reference

## Motivations

I started this project as a demonstration of A-Frame for the UMD XR Club. Hopefully this project will get other members of the club interested in A-Frame.
