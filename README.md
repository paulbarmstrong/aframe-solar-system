# Solar System A-Frame Scene

## Details

* Author: Paul Armstrong
* Date: December 2018
* Progress: 30%

## Description

This is an A-Frame scene I am creating as a demonstration of A-Frame to the UMD XR Club. This scene models the solar system in true scale.

## Usage

You can view the project as a webpage [here](https://rawgit.com/paulbarmstrong/aframe-solar-system/master/index.html).

## Plans

* Create an option for bodies' paths to be traced with a line
* Create an option to automatically convert to the frame of reference of nearest body
* Add a smooth interpolation transition when swapping frames of reference

## Motivations

I started this project as a demonstration of A-Frame for the UMD XR Club. Hopefully this project will get other members of the club interested in A-Frame.
